    <h5>What are Learning Units?</h5>

    <p>They are the components of a qualification, consisting of a coherent set of knowledge, skills and competence, which can be assessed and validated</p>
    <p>To compose Learning Units, sets of learning outcomes with a specific connection must be pooled together. These learning outcomes may be part of a specific specialization (such as beverages, accounting, labour legislation, etc.) or relate to the fulfilment of a defined professional task (such as hair dyeing, bread baking, compiling financial statements, etc.).</p>

    <p>
        The title of a unit of learning outcomes should be clear and comprehensible) and it should reflect the content of the unit. Furthermore, the level of the unit of learning outcomes is to be noted separately.</p>
    <p>
        The designer must consider the fact that each learning outcome (or the acquired knowledge, skills and competences) should be assessable on their own, that is separate from the other learning units.
