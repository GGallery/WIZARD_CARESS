        </span>
    </span>

    <p>
        After defining the list of competencies which should characterize the profile of the homecare professional you’re targeting, you should compare this list with a number of information in order to identify a possible competency gap.
    </p>

    <span class="focus">
        COMPARE YOUR COMPETENCY LIST with the information collected in STEP 1
    </span>

    <p>
        Then you can write down a list of competencies <strong>which SHOULD characterize the professional you’re targeting but are NOT ACTUALLY included in the professional profile</strong>
    </p>

    <span class="focus">
        WRITE DOWN THE “COMPETENCY GAP LIST”  possibly distinguishing between "horizontal" and "profession-specific" GAP
    </span>
