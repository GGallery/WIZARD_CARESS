<p>
    Take the table in which you detailed the learning outcomes of your CLM.

<span class="focus">
        <p>IDENTIFY THE PROPER LEARNING STRATEGY FOR EACH LEARNING OUTCOME</p>
    </span>

<p>
    There’s no magic formula to solve design problems and there’s no effective learning strategy for every context, target user and learning outcome. <strong>But, taking into account your “design constraints”</strong> it is possible <strong>to define the most proper learning strategy for each learning outcome.</strong>
</p>

<p>You could formalize your choice of your learning strategies by including them in the design table you previously used to detail your learning outcomes (Activity 2 – Step3)</p>

<p>
    On the one hand each learning strategy and the relative learning activity can cover more than one learning outcome; on the other hand, each learning outcome can be targeted through different learning strategies. So, after identifying the proper learning strategy for each learning outcome, try to group them according to the strategy.

<p>So, if needed</p>

    </span>

<p>
    As to the identification of the proper Learning Strategies, a number theories, well -stablished practices and patterns have formalized and shared by experts

<p>
    If the “design constraints” allow/advise you to <strong>set up one or more e-learning modules</strong>, now itis the time to define them. Especially in adult training, learning time is particularly precious so, when contextual constraints are favorable, it is advisable to use e-learning to address specific learning objectives.

        <p>IDENTIFY POSSIBLE E-LEARNING MODULES</p>
    </span>

<p>
    Interactive multimedia materials, videos or downloadable papers can often replace a traditional presence lesson, when it targets theoretical or factual knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover e-learning can be used also to address other kind of learning objectives and to implement more active learning strategies.
