<span class="focus">
        <p>For each competency try to DEFINE ONE or MORE LEARNING OUTCOMES in terms of KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND TRANSVERSAL AND PERSONAL COMPETENCES</p>
    </span>

<h5>What are knowledge, skills and transversal and personal competences?</h5>

<p>
    <strong>KNOWLEDGE </strong>means the outcome of the assimilation of information through learning. Knowledge is the body of facts, principles, theories and practices that is related to a field of work or study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SKILL </strong>is the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how to complete tasks and solve problems.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Competences </strong>comprises personal, social and/or methodological abilities which could be put into play in society and at work.</p>

<p>Transversal Competences are those typically considered as not specifically related to a particular job, task, academic discipline or area of knowledge but as competences that can be used in a wide variety of situations and work settings.</p>
<p>In the definition of a “learning outcome” <strong>TRANSVERSAL AND PERSONAL COMPETENCES </strong>are described in terms of “competences needed for applying a knowledge and/or a skill in the work context <strong>with a certain level of responsibility and autonomy”.</strong></p>

<p>To make a list of your Learning Outcomes you can follow a template like this (based on results of the EU funder ENhANCE project https://www.enhance-fcn.eu/)</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr class="bkgOrangeMiddle"><td colspan="2"><strong>
                Learning Outcome: “n”

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Knowledge</strong> <br>
            He/she is able to:<br>
            •	< describe knowledge that refers to skills and competencies with active vocabulary like describe, explain etc.>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Skills</strong> <br>
            He/she is able to:<br>
            •	< describe functions/part of the work process with active vocabulary and result, if necessary use adverbial determinations>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
            <strong>Transversal, social and personal competences</strong><br>
            He/she is able to:<br>
            •	< describe transversal and personal competences needed for applying the above knowledge and skills in the work context detailing the level of responsibility and autonomy>

        </td>

<span class="lampadinaBox">
        The <strong>European Qualification Framework (EQF)</strong>, which defines 8 main reference levels for qualifications, set up a list of descriptors indicating the relevant learning outcomes for each of them. <strong>Check your Learning Outcomes  with these descriptors in order to verify if they are compliant with the EQF level of your CLM!</strong>

<h5>How can you formulate your Learning Outcomes?</h5>

<p>Basically, learning outcomes should be understandable, verifiable and assessable, in order to enable learners and teachers to judge whether the results have actually been achieved.</p>
