            STEP 3: DEFINE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA, TOOLS AND ACTIVITIES

        </span>

    </span>


<p>
    After identifying a list of learning outcomes and grouping them into Learning Units, your next step is to define the specific learning strategy you will implement to address each outcome.
</p>
<p>
    This design process should take into account all of the <strong>“design constraints” characterizing both the baseline course and the CLM.</strong>
</p>
You’ve already analyzed some contextual constraints (Action 1 – Step 1), but you need to be sure to take into account a number of dimensions.

        <p>FIND AN ANSWER TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS</p>
    </span>

<ul class="listaspunta">
    <li>What are the main characteristics of your actual specific target-users (the learners)? Are they mainly workers? Are new-graduates? How much time can they dedicate each day to VET? Would it be helpful for them to have practical experiences of work on the job? Would it be helpful for them to attend part of the course in e-learning? Do they have the proper ICT competences?</li>
    <li>Is there any law or rule (national or local) for VET in homecare which could affect the organization of your course? Think about the number of hours planned for the course, prerequisites for the recognition of the qualification, etc. Can informal learning be recognized in some way?</li>
    <li>What are the resources (<em>economic, logistics, technical, human resources, etc.</em>) you can rely on?  Can you invest money? Have you got any previous learning material and other resources you can reuse in this course? Can you produce new materials? Can you pay for experts? Do you have the resources to guarantee the involvement of proper teachers? Have you got locals and equipment suitable for presence learning? Do you have an e-learning platform?</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should take into account that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Practice is essential in older adults homecare and EU policies foster more and more work-based learning; but “work-based learning” may be difficult to manage when the “job place” is the older adult’s home;
        in some countries apprenticeships are very often limited to institutional contexts or older adults’ residences, due to organizational and assurance problems, while in other countries (especially in the North Europe) apprenticeship is well integrated in the VET system.</li>
    <li>Knowledge should be <strong>situated, contextualized, and linked to practice</strong>, and this is especially true in the field of Health and Social care: mental schemata, attitudes and procedures are as fundamental as transversal, social and personal competences. In order to develop these competences non-formal and informal learning processes  are highly recommended.</li>
    <li>Each country or region usually has its own <strong>specific rules concerning VET</strong>; they must be taken into account in order to set a course which could be recognized by regulatory bodies.</li>
</ul>

        <p>DEFINE A LIST OF WHAT IS ADVISABLE AND WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF LEARNING METHODS, STRATEGIES AND CONTEXTS</p>
    </span>

<span class="exampleBox">
        Here is a possible example of the list of your “design constraints”
        <ul class="listaspunta">
            <li>it is/isn’t possible/advisable to envisage (or to formally recognize) non-formal and informal learning units or modules;</li>
            <li>it is/isn’t possible/advisable to set “work-based learning” activities;</li>
            <li>it is/isn’t possible/advisable to envisage e-learning units or modules;</li>
            <li>it is/isn’t possible/advisable to set collaborative learning activities to be carried out by groups of learners;</li>
            <li>it is/isn’t possible/advisable to use ICTs for supporting presence learning activities.</li>
</ul>
